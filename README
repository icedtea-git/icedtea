IcedTea7
========

The IcedTea project provides a harness to build the source code from
openjdk.java.net using Free Software tools and dependencies.

IcedTea addresses two problems: it eliminates the build requirement on
proprietary build tools and provides additional patches and features
not available in OpenJDK.

IcedTea also provides build scripts and patches that fix a number of issues
which are as yet unresolved upstream.

See INSTALL for build instructions.

Java compatibility
------------------

IcedTea is derived from OpenJDK, Sun's open-source implementation of
the Java SE platform.  At this time the build from which IcedTea was
constructed corresponds to an early build of JDK 7.  When JDK 7 is
complete it will implement the Java SE 7 Platform Specification.  Any
APIs in the JDK 7 implementation, whether new or old, are therefore
subject to minor adjustments, major revisions, or even outright
removal between now and the time that the Java SE 7 Platform
Specification is finalized.  Please take these facts into account
before depending upon IcedTea.

A Note About License Headers
----------------------------

Some sources downloaded from openjdk.java.net do not display the GPL
license header.  Instances are:

The Zero Assembler and Shark Ports
==================================

Gary Benson has developed a port of the interpreter included in the
HotSpot virtual machine which avoids using any assembly language.  As
a pure C++ interpreter, it should be possible to build this on most
architectures and have a working (albeit slow) version of OpenJDK.
Successful builds have been made on ppc, ppc64 and arm.  The zero
assembler port is enabled by default on platforms other than x86,
x86_64 and sparc.  To enable it on these platforms, use the
--enable-zero option.

Gary is now working on a JIT called Shark to provide better
performance on platforms which need to use the zero port. A
preliminary version of this is now included with IcedTea and can be
built with the --enable-shark option.

CACAO as VM
===========

The CACAO virtual machine (http://cacaovm.org) can be used as an
alternative to the HotSpot virtual machine. One advantage of this is
that it already provides a JIT for many platforms to which HotSpot has
not yet been ported, including ppc, ppc64, arm and mips.  To use CACAO
as the VM, use the --with-cacao option.  This will download a snapshot
of CACAO during the build, which has been tested with this version of
IcedTea7.

The environment variable CACAO_CONFIGURE_ARGS can be used to pass
additional arguments to the cacao configure.

PulseAudio Mixer
================

Passing --enable-pulse-java to configure will build the PulseAudio Mixer for 
java. This allows java programs to use PulseAudio as the sound backend.

SystemTap Support
=================

The --enable-systemtap configure option will try to find the systemtap
runtime development files (sdt.h and the dtrace python script wrapper),
enable compilation of static markers in the hotspot code and install a
systemtap hotspot.stp tapset for easy tracing with systemtap's stap
utility. The probes are documented in tapset/hotspot.stp.

This requires the systemtap-sdt-devel package as build dependency and
optionally the systemtap package at run time when the user want to use
the tapset to trace java programs. The probes have zero overhead when
not used and can safely be compiled in even when not used at runtime.

Support for Additional VMs
==========================

Although IcedTea can be built multiple times to use a different virtual
machine, additional VMs can be built without building the other components
multiple times.

On architectures where hotspot is available, use
   --with-additional-vms=cacao,zero  (or shark instead of zero)
on architectures where only zero (or shark) is available, use
   --with-additional-vms=cacao
to build the additional VM's.  It's not possible to build cacao as the
default VM, and zero as additional VM.
To build zero as the default VM and shark as an additional VM, use
   --enable-zero --with-additional-vms=shark

The additional VM's are available by calling the java with the option
`-cacao', `-zero' or `-shark', or by calling the java tools with
`-J-<vm name>'. If the build was configured with '--enable-shark',
use `-Xint' to just use the zero VM.
