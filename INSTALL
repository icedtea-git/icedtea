Building IcedTea7
=================

For convenience we've provided make targets that automatically
download, extract and patch the source code from the IcedTea forest
(http://hg.openjdk.java.net/icedtea/jdk7/).

The build requirements are as follows:

A bootstrap JDK, either:
  - GNU libgcj 4.4.0 (or equivalent class library based on GNU Classpath >= 0.95) for --enable-bootstrap mode (the default)
  - IcedTea6 or IcedTea7 for --disable-bootstrap mode
CUPS
libX11 (libXp, libXtst, libXi, libXt, libXinerama)
Freetype2
patch
sed
tar
sha256sum (from coreutils)
wget
alsa
xsltproc (for bootstrapping)
ant >= 1.6.5 with the regexp task from ant-nodeps
glib2-devel (for --enable-system-gio)
gtk2-devel (for --enable-system-gtk)
giflib-devel (for --enable-system-gif)
libpng-devel (for --enable-system-png)
libjpeg-devel >= 6b (for --enable-system-jpeg)
zlib-devel (for --enable-system-zlib)
fontconfig (for --enable-system-fontconfig)
libc6-dev & libattr-devel/libattr1-dev (for --enable-compile-against-syscalls)
libpcsclite (for --enable-system-pcsc)
rhino (can be disabled using --without-rhino)
libffi (for --enable-zero or on archs other than x86/x86_64/sparc/ppc64)
pulseaudio-libs-devel >= 0.9.11 (for --enable-pulse-java)
LLVM 2.5 or later (for --enable-shark)
systemtap-sdl-devel >= 0.9.5 (Java method tracing requires systemtap >= 0.9.9)

See ./configure --help if you need to override the defaults.

To bootstrap IcedTea with ecj and a GNU Classpath-based JDK:
./autogen.sh
./configure 
make

To build IcedTea with an older version of IcedTea, use:
./autogen.sh
./configure --disable-bootstrap 
make

The following locations are checked for a JDK:
    * /usr/lib/jvm/icedtea-6
    * /usr/lib/jvm/icedtea6
    * /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk
    * /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk.x86_64
    * /usr/lib64/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk
    * /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0
    * /usr/lib/jvm/java-openjdk
    * /usr/lib/jvm/openjdk
    * /usr/lib/jvm/java-icedtea
    * /etc/alternatives/java_sdk_openjdk
in the order given above.

If bootstrapping is enabled, the following JDK locations are prepended to the above list:
   * /usr/lib/jvm/java-gcj
   * /usr/lib/jvm/gcj-jdk
   * /usr/lib/jvm/cacao

There is currently no install target.  IcedTea ends up in
openjdk.build when the build completes.

Most targets in IcedTea creat stamp files in the stamps directory to
determine what and when dependencies were compiled.  Each target has a
corresponding clean-x target which removes the output and the stamp
file, allowing it to be rebuilt.  For example, stamps/rt.stamp (alias
rt) builds the bootstrap classes needed in the bootstrap build and
clean-rt removes the classes and the stamp file.

Testing
=======

IcedTea7 includes support for running the test suite included with
OpenJDK, using the in-tree copy of JTReg.  Invoking 'make check' will
cause the HotSpot, JDK and langtools test suites to be run.  The
individual test suites may be run using the check-hotspot, check-jdk
and check-langtools targets respectively.  The --disable-tests option
can be used to turn off all tests, and the
--disable-{hotspot,langtools,jdk}-tests options can be used to turn
off individual suites.  This is useful when using 'make distcheck'
as a way of avoiding running the extensive JDK test suite which
takes several hours.

The PulseAudio provider
=======================

IcedTea7 includes an implementation of the javax.sound.* APIs using
PulseAudio which can be enabled using --enable-pulse-java.   The resulting
provider is org.classpath.icedtea.pulseaudio.PulseAudioMixerProvider.

XRender Support
===============

IcedTea7 includes support for an Xrender-based rendering pipeline
developed by Clemens Eisserer (http://linuxhippy.blogspot.com/).  This
is compiled by default, and can be disabled using --disable-xrender.
To actually use the pipeline, the sun.java2d.xrender property needs to
be set to true, e.g.  by passing the -Dsun.java2d.xrender=True option
to java.

SystemTap
=========

IcedTea7 includes work to allow the existing DTrace probes included in
OpenJDK to be used with SystemTap.  This requires version 0.9.5 or later (0.9.9
or later if you want Java method tracing).  The tapset needs to know
the final install location of the JDK, so the --with-abs-install-dir option
should also be used to specify this.  If not set, it defaults to the
in-tree location of openjdk.build/j2sdk-image and requires
manual changes to tapset/hotspot.stp to work from elsewhere. For
example, if you plan to install the resulting build in
/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk, then you should specify
--with-abs-install-dir=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk.

NSS Security Provider
=====================

OpenJDK includes an NSS-based security provider in the form of
sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11.  However, as this needs to know the
location of the NSS installation it should use, it is not enabled
in normal OpenJDK builds.  As IcedTea can detect NSS using configure,
it can simplify the process of enabling this provider by generating
a configuration file for the NSS provider.  If --enable-nss is specified,
this configuration will be turned on in lib/security/java.security.
This can also be done manually at a later date.

CACAO
=====

IcedTea7 can use CACAO as the virtual machine, as opposed to HotSpot.
One advantage of this is that CACAO has a JIT implementation for
more platforms than HotSpot, including ppc, ppc64, arm and mips.
When --enable-cacao is specified, CACAO will be downloaded and built,
followed by the JDK portion of OpenJDK resulting in a CACAO+OpenJDK
image in openjdk.build/j2sdk-image.  The --with-cacao-home
option can be used to specify the use of an existing CACAO install
instead, and --with-cacao-src-zip/dir options exist to allow the use
of a pre-downloaded zip or source tree respectively.

JamVM
=====

IcedTea6 can use JamVM as the virtual machine, as opposed to HotSpot.
When --enable-jamvm is specified, JamVM will be downloaded and built,
followed by the JDK portion of OpenJDK resulting in a JamVM+OpenJDK
image in openjdk.build/j2sdk-image.  The --with-jamvm-src-zip option
exists to allow the use of a pre-downloaded zip.

Zero & Shark
============

IcedTea7 includes a zero assembler port of HotSpot, which avoids
architecture-specific code as much as possible, allowing an
interpreter to be built and run on most platforms (albeit very
slowly).  As HotSpot only includes JITs for x86, x86_64 and SPARC, the
zero assembler port is automatically enabled on all other
architectures.  On x86, x86_64 and SPARC, it may be built using
--enable-zero.

To overcome the performance issues inherent in zero, a LLVM-based JIT
called Shark has been developed.  This performs Just-In-Time compilation
on any architecture supported by LLVM.  To enable it, pass the option
--enable-shark to configure.  Please note that Shark is still in
development and builds are still likely to fail at present.

On ARM32, there is also a native JIT port built on top of Zero. This
still has issues and is thus not enabled by default. To enable it,
pass --enable-arm32-jit to configure.

Support for Different Versions of HotSpot
=========================================

IcedTea allows the version of HotSpot provided with the upstream build
drop to be replaced with another.  Support for this is provided by the
--with-hotspot-build option which causes IcedTea to probe the
hotspot.map file for an entry with the given build name.  The
hotspot.map file maps the name to a changeset from a given repository
URL.  During the build, it downloads HotSpot from
${URL}/archive/${CHANGESET}.tar.gz and the resulting file is verified
using the MD5 sum stored in hotspot.map.

New build selections may be provided by providing further mappings in
the hotspot.map file.  The name can be anything
e.g. 'shiny_new_hotspot'.  This is simply used to map the argument to
--with-hotspot-build to the values in the file and to apply
appropriate patches (see patches/hotspot, $HSBUILD is available in
Makefile.am for obtaining the build name).  The special value
'original' is used for patches/hotspot/original to denote those for
the upstream HotSpot; this value does not appear in hotspot.map.  

The changeset and URL should refer to a valid HotSpot tree when used
as above.  The required values can be obtained from a local checkout
or by using the web interface.  The simplest way to calculate the MD5
sum is to download the tarball and then run the 'md5sum' application
on it.  The resulting value should be added to hotspot.map.

As with the OpenJDK build tarballs, the location of an alternate zip
can be specified using --with-hotspot-src-zip.  This skips the
download stage and just verifies that the zip's MD5 sum matches that
of the requested build.

Currently, IcedTea7 only supports the 'original' HotSpot provided as
part of the upstream IcedTea forest.

JavaScript Support
==================

IcedTea7 adds Javascript support via the javax.script API by using
an existing installation of Rhino.  Support is enabled by default,
with the following locations being searched for a Rhino JAR file:

* /usr/share/java/rhino.jar
* /usr/share/java/js.jar
* /usr/share/rhino-1.6/lib/js.jar

A JAR file can instead be specified using the --with-rhino option,
or support may be disabled by specifying --without-rhino.

Note that the final installed JAR file is a modified version with the
namespace prefixed by 'sun.' as in the proprietary Oracle JDK.  This
avoids conflicts between the JDK's copy of Rhino and any used by other
applications.

Bootstrap Tools
===============

For bootstrap builds, the option --disable-bootstrap-tools can be used
to make use of the javac and javah built as part of the langtools build,
rather than the bootstrap tools.  The default setting of this option is
to use the bootstrap tools when they support Java 1.7 (tested at
configure time).

Building Additional Virtual Machines
====================================

Although IcedTea can be built multiple times to use a different virtual
machine, additional VMs can be built without building the other components
multiple times.

On architectures where hotspot is available, use
   --with-additional-vms=cacao,zero  (or shark instead of zero)
on architectures where only zero (or shark) is available, use
   --with-additional-vms=cacao
to build the additional VMs.  It's not possible to build cacao as the
default VM, and zero as additional VM.
To build zero as the default VM and shark as an additional VM, use
   --enable-zero --with-additional-vms=shark

The additional VMs are available by calling the java with the option
`-cacao', `-zero' or `-shark', or by calling the java tools with
`-J-<vm name>'. If the build was configured with '--enable-shark',
use `-Xint' to just use the zero VM.

Please note that using this feature does not do as extensive testing
of the VM as would enabling it in the default full bootstrap mode,
which compiles IcedTea and then recompiles it using the just-built
image.
