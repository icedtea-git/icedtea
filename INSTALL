Building IcedTea
================

For convenience we've provided make targets that automatically
download, extract and patch the source code from openjdk.java.net, in
a default location.

To build IcedTea, do:

./configure
make

There is currently no install target.

The build requirements are as follows:

GNU libgcj 4.1.2
Eclipse Java Compiler 3.2.1
CUPS
libX11
lesstif
patch
sed
unzip
md5sum
wget

See ./configure --help if you need to override defaults.

IcedTea ends up in openjdk/control/build/linux-i586 or
openjdk/control/build/linux-amd64 when the build completes.

Building IcedTea with IcedTea
-----------------------------

To perform a full bootstrap, do:

./configure
make bootstrap

The bootstrap target builds IcedTea against ecj running on libgcj
first then uses the result of that build to build IcedTea again.
