New in release 1.11 (2009-08-06)

- Updated to OpenJDK7 b66 (Milestone 4), including
  JSR 308: Annotations on Java types.
- Updates/bug fixes for netx, Shark and the web plugin.
- Zero is now provided in the upstream forest rather than in-tree.
- The options
  - --with-openjdk
  - --with-icedtea
  - --with-openjdk-home
  - --with-icedtea-home
  - --with-gcj-jdk
  have been removed.  The JDK is now specified by --with-jdk-home
  and whether or not do a full bootstrap or not is now decided
  by --disable-bootstrap (the default is yes).  This is in preparation
  for making the two stages independent of the JDK used, but some
  artefacts still remain in this release; the supported behaviour
  is still the use of gcj jdk for a full bootstrap and icedtea
  for a quick build.
- Added java method tracing using systemtap version 0.9.9+.
- Added latest security fixes.

New in release 1.10 (2009-05-29)

- Updated to OpenJDK7 b59 build via IcedTea forest.  Now includes
  SCTP and Nimbus Swing look and feel.
- Static trace support through systemtap.
  When given the configure option --enable-systemtap IcedTea will build
  hotspot with the dtrace static markers enabled and install an hotspot
  tapset that can be used to dynamically trace execution of java
  applications at runtime. See the tapset/hotspot.stp file for
  documentation of the various trace points and arguments available.
- Allow building of other virtual machines besides the default VM. Additional
  virtual machines on architectures where hotspot is available are cacao
  and zero (or shark), and cacao, where zero (or shark) is available. It's
  not possible to build cacao as the default VM, and zero as additional VM.
- New options --enable-nimbus and --enable-nimbus-generation.  The default
  is that the first is on but the second is off, so Nimbus is built but
  without needing to generate the files using JIBX (http://jibx.sourceforge.net/).
- VisualVM updated to 1.1.1.
- Many build fixes, notably to make netx/the plugin work.  IcedTea7 now
  avoids the binary plug mechanism in favour of using the same method as
  CORBA, JAXP, JAXWS and langtools to import the plugin/netx code.
- Several web browser plugin and javaws support fixes:
  - Fixed security handling to prevent access denials when there is a site
  specific exception in the policy file
  - Allow extensions (chrome) to run Java code with full permissions
  - Added non-trusted SSL support to WebStart (javaws)
  - Added proxy support
  - Other improvements that were breaking specific sites (tag parser fix,
    nested jar support, etc.)
  - Added JVM Console (used by http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/)
  - Experimental new plugin enabled by --enable-npplugin.
  - Original plugin is now enabled by --enable-plugin, not --enable-liveconnect.
- LCMS security fixes.
- Many build improvements.
- Many zero/shark jtreg fixes.
- Other bug fixes.

New in release 1.9 (2009-03-20)

- Security fixes for:
  CVE-2008-5360 - Temporary files have guessable file names.

  CVE-2008-5359 - Buffer overflow in image processing.
  CVE-2008-5351 - UTF-8 decoder accepts non-shortest form sequences.
  CVE-2008-5356 - Font processing vulnerability.
  CVE-2008-5353 - Calendar object deserialization allows privilege escalation.
  CVE-2008-5354 - Privilege escalation in command line applications.
  CVE-2008-5357 - Truetype Font processing vulnerability.
  CVE-2008-5352 - Jar200 Decompression buffer overflow.
  CVE-2008-5358 - Buffer Overflow in GIF image processing.
- Updated to OpenJDK7 b50 build.
- XRender pipeline support: Java2D are noticably faster and running over a 
  remote X connection feels like it is all local. Build by default
  (disable with --disable-xrender). Runtime enabled by running java
  -Dsun.java2d.xrender=True (default is to use the old X renderer for now).
- IcedTeaPlugin now supports HTTPS sites and adds a user prompt for
  untrusted https certificates.
- Use the ALSA 'default' device. Makes Java play nicer with PulseAudio.
- VisualVM integration updated to 1.1.1
- Gervill soft synthesizer integration updated to latest CVS version.
- Integrated jtreg upgraded to 4_0-src-b02-15_oct_2008.
- make check runs much faster now. jtreg -samevm support has been
  integrated into the langtools and jdk subsystems. Please package the
  test/jtreg-summary.log file with your distribution package so end users
  can compare the test results.
- Shark (--enable-shark) now builds on 64 bit platforms, but is a
  pre-alpha technology preview and not recommended for use.
- Better support for bootstrapping with different jar programs
  (supporting -J options).
- If --with-pkgversion isn't given the short mercurial rev node version
  will be used.  Package distributors are encouraged to build packages with
  --with-pkgversion to uniquely identify their distribution version number
  when java -version is run to help distribution specific bug reporting.
- Various freetype font, pisces renderer and awt X window size fixes
  to fix visual anomalies.
- Build fixes for gcc 4.3 and 4.4-pre-release.
- Added support for building against a specific openjdk src dir
  or hg revision (--with-openjdk-src-dir or --with-hg-revision).
- Many other Plugin, Zero, Shark and PulseAudio bug fixes.
- Build clean up.
- Updated to CACAO 0.99.4.

New in release 1.8 (2008-11-20)

  IcedTea is based on the hard work of a lot of people that contributed to
  IcedTea6 and OpenJDK. The following noteworthy changes were added in
  this release:

- Updated to b39 build.
- Support for external projects (closures, caciocavallo, cvmi, bsd, nio2).
  Note that these are based on Mercurial repositories so may require local
  changes for a working build due to noticeable differences between the

  (See http://icedtea.classpath.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=179 when
   you want to enable non-system-installed versions of Rhino).
- Add support for Zero builds on alpha, arm, mips, mipsel, m68k, s390.
- Various build fixes.
- Several bug and security fixes.
- Plugin including LiveConnect support built as default.

New in release 1.7 (2008-06-02)

  IcedTea is based on the hard work of a lot of people that contributed to
  IcedTea6 and OpenJDK. The following noteworthy changes were added in
  this release:

  - Paul Hohensee published a GNU/Linux hotspot Sparc port and Matthias
   Klose integrated it into IcedTea.
  - Keith Seiths and Andrew Haley made fixes to the awt color package so
   that it now provides the lcms library with PYCC and LINEAR_RGB ICC
   profiles, fixing several applications that did complex color
   transformations.
  - Karl Helgason wrote a midi software synthesizer called Gervill that
   is now integrated in IcedTea so that javax.sound.midi support works
   now. Mark Wielaard integrated it and made some fixes so that it works
   better with javax.sound.sampled.
  - Jonathan Gibbons released a free version of jtreg, which was imported
   into IcedTea by Mark Wielaard so that a make check now runs all the
   functional unit tests integrated into OpenJDK.
  - Joshua Sumali made lots of fixes to the javaws/netx support. Including
   improved security, namely catching Socket permissions during runtime,
   implementing the remaining JNLP services api (PrintService and
   JNLPRandomAccessFile), and applet focusing bug fixes, so now netx
   plays nice with gcjwebplugin.
  - Kelly O'Hair resolved the license issues with the (j)hat tool which is
   now integrated.
  - Lillian Angel and Tom Fitzsimmons added several .desktop files for
   the various tools included for better GNU/Linux desktop integration.
  - Thomas Fitzsimmons rewrote the cacert support to resolve issues with
   applications like Glashfish and Eclipse which access the keystore
   directly.
  - Lillian Angel made lots of bug fixes to the packaging and integration
   support, include improving the font support.
  - IcedTea6 1.2 and IcedTea[7] 1.7 are completely synced up again thanks
   to Andrew John Hughes.
  - Andrew also did all the work to make sure IcedTea[7] is now based on
   OpenJDK7 b26 as released by Xiomara Jayasena.
  - Thomas Fitzsimmons rewrote the certificate keystore support.
  - Christian Thalinger made various cacao integration fixes.
